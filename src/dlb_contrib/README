This is a namespace package according to PEP 420.
There is no __init__.py on purpose.

Each module in this package must contain the following:

 - Exactly one line '# SPDX-License-Identifier: <license>' in the first comment block with <license> listed here:
   https://spdx.org/licenses/

 - A module docstring that starts with single sentence describing the tasks its content abstracts.

 - In the second comment block at the top with
    - a reference block and
    - at least one complete usage example, starting with '# Usage example:' and indented by 2 spaces
      (this is extracted for the documentation)

  - A list '__all__' of all objects intended to be used by dlb scripts, grouped by their type.

  - A Python version check based on sys.version_info.
    Example:
       assert sys.version_info >= (3, 7)

A comment block consists of consecutive lines starting with '#'.

The reference block consists of consecutive lines of the form
'# <aspect>: <value>', where <aspect> does not contain ':' and does not start with ' '.
The same <aspect> can be given multiple times.

It should contain references to abstracted external tool, language or file format, preferrably as URLs
enclosed in '<' ... '>'.
It should contain an <aspect> 'Tested with' for each tested configuration.
It should contain an <aspect> 'Executable' for the name of each dynamic helper that is potentially executed
by one of its tools.

See dlb_contrib.git for an example.

The content of the modules should be described by comments (not docstrings) with emphasis on examples.

The name of a subclass of dlb.ex.Tool should denote the task it performs (e.g. 'CCompilerGcc') or the tool itself
(e.g. 'Doxygen') if the executable(s) can only serve a single purpose.
