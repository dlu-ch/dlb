Explicit is better than implicit
================================

dlb is a `Pythonic <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_ build tool that does not try to mimic
`Make <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29>`_, but brings the benefits of object-oriented languages
to the build process.
It is inspired by `djb's redo <https://cr.yp.to/redo.html>`_.

dlb requires at least Python 3.6 (and nothing else).
