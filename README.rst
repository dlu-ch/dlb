dlb - explicit is better than implicit
======================================

dlb is a `Pythonic <https://www.python.org/>`_ build tool which does not try to mimic Make_, but brings the benefits of object oriented languages
to the build process.
It is inspired by `djb's redo <https://cr.yp.to/redo.html>`_.

See [here](doc/index.rst) for more.
