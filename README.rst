dlb - explicit is better than implicit
======================================

dlb is a `Pythonic <https://www.python.org/>`_ build tool which does not try to mimic `Make <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29>`_, but brings the benefits of object oriented languages
to the build process.
It is inspired by `djb's redo <https://cr.yp.to/redo.html>`_.

See doc/index.rst for more.
